# Steganography-using-C_Programming
Steganography application in C to encode and decode secret messages within digital images. The project involved manipulating pixel values in image files to embed and extract information, ensuring minimal visual impact on the cover image. Used advanced algorithms for efficient data hiding and retrieval, maintaining the integrity of both the cover and hidden data.
This project showcases strong proficiency in C programming, data manipulation, and algorithm design, highlighting the ability to work on complex and creative problem-solving tasks.
